    scope:
      - Public catalog -> game page -> play web build in-browser.
      - Admin authoring: team -> game -> upload -> preview -> publish -> tags -> status/remark.
      - Minimal filtering/sorting by tags.
      - Admin-only CRUD for Teams/Games/Builds.
      - Game status transitions: editing/published/archived.

    exit_criteria:
      architecture_ready:
        - ADRs for front stack, back stack, repo layout, local dev deps recorded in docs/QNA_DECISIONS.md
        - RUNBOOK contains install/run/test commands for selected stack
        - Repo scaffolding created (front/ and back/) OR documented reason to use a different layout

        - ack.architecture filled (by/at/scope)

        - docs/TESTS.md has UAT/BDD + Acceptance + RTM + Planned Test Files for FP1
        - ack.tests_red_spec filled (by/at/scope)

    risks:
      - Embed policies may reduce compatibility for some games.
      - Admin-only scope may expand UI work.
      - Stack decisions may affect test layout and deployment simplicity.

    reflection:
      - what_went_well: Implemented minimal front/back MVP flow (admin authoring + upload + publish) and added docker-compose with MongoDB + MinIO.
      - risks: Coverage is not verified; Docker flow is dev-oriented and needs validation.
      - next_focus: Run coverage scripts and capture artifacts, then proceed to tests-green.
      - skills: implementation-approach + coding-rules guided minimal changes; testing used to align with RTM.

      - UI changes: remove Teams sidebar, remove ratings, add comments, login/username button in top-left with burger menu.
      - Windows 95 styled modals: login/registration (draggable), game play modal (draggable).

    risks:

      - Authentication system adds complexity (password hashing, session management, email service).
      - Team membership model needs clear permission rules.
      - Draggable modals may have accessibility and mobile compatibility challenges.

    reflection:
      - what_went_well: All 14 questions answered; ADRs created for critical decisions (password policy, recovery codes, team leadership, JWT auth, Windows 95 styling, comments model). UX_MAP updated with 26 CTAs for FP4 including authentication, team management, game editing, comments, and play modal. API.yaml and MODEL.sql aligned with FP4 requirements (users collection, teams.leader/members, comments collection). Architecture decisions documented: @nestjs/jwt for JWT, bcrypt for password hashing, nodemailer for email, custom Windows 95 components replacing MUI, React Context for auth state, NestJS guards/decorators for permissions. TESTS.md updated with 21 planned test files for FP4. Red tests created: 12 backend tests (auth, teams, games, comments) and 11 frontend tests (auth flows, catalog visibility, teams, game editor, comments, play modal, Windows 95 UI). All tests are red (expected) as implementation not yet done.
      - risks: Windows 95 styling replacement of MUI Material 3 will require significant refactoring (all components need rebuild). Email service configuration needs documentation and example setup. Draggable modals need custom implementation (no library). Team permission checks need careful testing. JWT token expiration (7 days) may require refresh mechanism later. Tests will fail until implementation is complete (expected red state).
      - next_focus: Proceed to implement stage to make tests green. Start with backend auth module, then frontend auth context, then Windows 95 components, then remaining features.
      - skills: testing-strategy used to structure red tests; testing applied to ensure comprehensive coverage; documentation-criteria ensured test alignment with UAT/BDD.
      - implement_20260109: Implemented 12 UI/UX fixes from CR-FP4-20260109-03: (1) Hide "Add Member" button for unregistered users in team info modal, (2) Real-time filtering by game name in catalog, (3) "View Games" redirect with team filter and team name tag, (4) Fixed login/register modal height (not full screen), (5) Replaced login/register buttons with visual tabs in AuthModal, (6) Made team info modal smaller, (7) Display leader and members' logins instead of UUIDs (backend returns leaderLogin/memberLogins), (8) Fixed game creation page functionality (endpoint paths), (9) Removed visual highlighting from Settings tab, (10) Fixed CORS errors for local network IP access, (11) Added left margin to PlayModal game iframe, (12) Build URL expiration issue noted (uses public URLs, signed URLs may need backend changes). Backend: Updated TeamsController to return user logins, added getUserLogin to TeamsService, updated CORS config. Frontend: Updated team info modal, added team filtering in catalog, fixed endpoint paths, updated AuthModal with tabs, fixed modal sizing.
      - implement_20260109_playmodal: Fixed PlayModal issues from CR-FP4-20260109-04: (1) Improved iframe loading with proper timeout (50ms) and console logging for debugging, (2) Fixed margins - added 8px margin on all sides, removed padding from modal content for Game title, adjusted container dimensions using calc() to prevent overflow. Games now load properly and iframe container has proper margins without overflow.
      - implement_20260109_cors: Fixed CORS issues for local network access from CR-FP4-20260109-05: (1) Enhanced backend CORS config with explicit origin callback, all required headers, preflight handling, fallback middleware, (2) Backend listens on 0.0.0.0 for all network interfaces, (3) Frontend auto-detects API URL based on hostname (IP → IP:3000, localhost → localhost:3000), (4) Added credentials: 'include' to fetch, (5) Fixed FormData handling (no Content-Type header). Site now accessible from any machine in local network without CORS errors.
      - implement_20260109_buildurl: Fixed build URL expiration issue from CR-FP4-20260109-06: Created BuildUrlService to generate signed S3 URLs dynamically on each game request (1-hour expiration), updated GamesController.getGame() to use BuildUrlService, installed @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner. Build URLs are now always fresh, no more "AccessDeniedRequest has expired" errors in PlayModal. Fixed signed URL hostname replacement (minio → localhost) in CR-FP4-20260109-07.
      - implement_20260109_ui_fixes: Fixed UI/UX issues from CR-FP4-20260109-07: (1) Fixed AuthModal and Team info modal heights (auto instead of full screen), (2) Fixed signed URL hostname in BuildUrlService (replaces internal Docker hostname with public URL), (3) Added Windows 95 hourglass loader to PlayModal (HourglassLoader component with animated sand), (4) Replaced "Edit" tab with "New Game" tab, (5) Fixed editor/games/new page to properly handle new game creation (form reset, create before upload).
      - implement_20260109_team_cover: Fixed team update and cover image issues from CR-FP4-20260109-08: (1) Fixed team not updating - added teamId to loadGame() and handleUpdateGame(), reloads game after update, (2) Fixed cover image loading - updated BuildUrlService to support any S3 URL path, generates signed URLs for cover_url, (3) Added hourglass loader for cover images (CoverImageWithLoader component with HourglassLoader).
      - implement_20260109_cover_upload: Refactored cover image upload from CR-FP4-20260109-09: (1) Created POST /games/:id/cover endpoint for S3 upload with 300 KB size limit and image type validation, (2) Changed GameDoc to store S3 key ("covers/{coverId}.{ext}") instead of full URL, (3) Added BuildUrlService.getSignedUrlFromKey() for generating signed URLs from S3 keys, (4) Removed cover URL input field - only file upload allowed, (5) Updated frontend to upload covers via new endpoint and reload game to get signed URL.
